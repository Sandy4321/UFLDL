# UFLDL
Solutions to the Unsupervised Feature Learning and Deep Learning (UFLDL) Tutorial 

## Overview
This repository contains solutions (in Python) for the Unsupervised Feature Learning and Deep Learning Tutorial. Each directory corresponds to an exercise in the [UFLDL tutorial](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page). Unfortunately, it looks like this tutorial is deprecated and the new [tutorial](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/) does not have all of the same exercises, so this repository may not be that useful for comparing solutions/debugging algorithms.
